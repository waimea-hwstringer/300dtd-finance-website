- Different account tiers dictate what the user can or can't do
- Admins can make posts and change peoples tiers

## Project Details

This is a digital media and database project for **NCEA Level 3**, assessed against standards [91902](docs/as91902.pdf) and [91903](docs/as91903.pdf).

The project is a web app that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server back-end, connecting to a SQLite database. The final deployment of the app is on [Render](https://render.com/), with the database hosted at [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

The app uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) templating for structuring pages and data, and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as the starting point for styling the web front-end.

The project demonstrates a number of **complex database techniques**:
- Structuring the data using multiple tables
- Creating queries which insert, update or delete to modify data
- Creating customised data displays from multiple tables (e.g. web pages)
- Dynamically linking data between the database and a front-end display
- Applying data access permissions as appropriate to the outcome

The project demonstrates a number of **complex digital media (web) techniques**:
- Using non-core functionality
- Using sophisticated digital effects
- Applying industry standards or guidelines
- Using responsive design for use on multiple devices
- The integration of original media assets
- Using dynamic data handling and interactivity
- Automation through scripts

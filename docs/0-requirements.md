# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My Dad wants to start a podcast for his finance advice, and needs a place where he can make posts and dictate who can see certain information. For example, members should be able to make a free account but they will not be able to see all the information. My Dad needs to be able to create his podcasts/blog posts, and easily manage who can see what.

## End-User Requirements

I will have two main groups of end users. The first is my Dad, who has some tech knowledge, and the second is my Dad's clients. The clients will have very varied tech know-how, some may not be confident using devices. The common denominator of the end-users will be wanting to learn about finance/money.

The website will need to be easy to use following common website conventions. It will also need to feel nice and clean to use, especially because some users will be paying for the service.

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.


## Proposed Solution

I will make a website for my Dad where he can make posts containing text, images and videos. These posts can be set to be accessible by different tiers. People with a free tier will only be able to see lower tier posts, but people with a higher tier will be able to see **everything**.

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

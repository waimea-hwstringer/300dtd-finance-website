# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My Dad wants to start a podcast for his finance advice, and needs a place where he can make posts and dictate who can see certain information. For example, members should be able to make a free account but they will not be able to see all the information. My Dad needs to be able to create his podcasts/blog posts, and easily manage who can see what.

## End-User Requirements

I will have two main groups of end users. The first is my Dad, who has some tech knowledge, and the second is my Dad's clients. The clients will have very varied tech know-how, some may not be confident using devices. The common denominator of the end-users will be wanting to learn about finance/money.

The website will need to be easy to use following common website conventions. It will also need to feel nice and clean to use, especially because some users will be paying for the service.

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.


## Proposed Solution

I will make a website for my Dad where he can make posts containing text, images and videos. These posts can be set to be accessible by different tiers. People with a free tier will only be able to see lower tier posts, but people with a higher tier will be able to see **everything**. People with higher tier accounts will be able to make their own posts or post comments.

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

Functionality is essentially something that works and is useful. Information or data displayed should be accurate. The website should work as expected.

### Relevance to the System

My website must display advice that is accurate. As the website is for financial advice, we do not want to provide the users with false advice as this could seriously affect their living situation. For example, we don't want to let people with free accounts make posts as these could be malicious or misleading. Therefore we must only allow people to post if they have been permitted.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to ensure that my website functions as intended. I could do this by testing each feature after it's added, and throughout the development of the site. I will also use multiple other people to trial out my website who have a range of technical knowledge as they may pick up on things that I don't notice.



## Usability

Usability is how easy the website is to use.

### Relevance to the System

It is crucial that this service is usable. If the users find the site frustrating or difficult then they will obviously not want to pay for the site. 

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to make my site as easy and intuitive to use as possible to ensure that a wide variety of people will be able to utilise and enjoy my site. I can do this by abiding by Neilssen's Usability Heuristics.
When I test the site I will need to use a wide variety of people to ensure that my site is easy to use for people of different technological and financial skill sets.



## Aesthetics

Aesthetics is how the website looks and feels. Things like the colour, layout and vibe about the website.

### Relevance to the System

Having a website that is aesthetically pleasing is a very important aspect to consider when designing a website. Users will not enjoy using the site if it is unpleasant to look at, or the design is laid out poorly.


### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider aspects like my colour palette when moving forward. I should test the website with several different colour palettes to see which one looks the most aesthetically pleasing.



## Social

The social implication essentially means how the website affects its users and society as a whole.

### Relevance to the System

My website will have a very wide range of users, that may not have a whole lot in common.

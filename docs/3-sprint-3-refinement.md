# Sprint 3 - A Refined and Complete System


## Sprint Goals

Develop the system until it is fully featured, with a refined UI and it satisfies the requirements. The system will be fully tested at this point.

## Final Implementation

The web app is fully implemented with a refined UI:

## Testing User Interfaces

Just having the text "delete" looks a little bit unrefined, common website conventions would use an icon. During my latest meeting with my client, I asked about whether or not he felt an icon would be better.

> "Well I think having the delete text is fine, but for accessibility and icon would be beneficial as well. Could you put a bin icon next to it?"

I then followed this sentiment and added an svg icon next to the delete text. I will follow this convention through out the site, to keep things accessible for everyone.

I also realised that whilst posts had a readable date and time, the comments did not.

This would not fit with the rest of the site and it is not very friendly for users to read, so I added a format that is consistent with the rest of the site.
